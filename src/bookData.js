      '"We’re all going to die" by Dr. Leah Kaminsky. Author / Creator: Kaminsky, Leah, 1959- author. Date: 2016. Summary: The one certainty about life is that everybody is going to die. Yet somehow as a society we have come to deny this central fact – we ignore it, hoping it will go away. Ours is an aging society, where we are all living longer, healthier lives, yet we find ourselves less and less prepared for our inevitable end. Leah Kaminsky is an award-winning writer and GP, who is confronted by death and mortality on a daily basis. She shares - and challenges - our fears of death and dying. But she also takes joy in people whose response to their imminent death is to choose, instead, to consciously embrace life. WE’RE ALL GOING TO DIE is an engaging, compassionate and compelling book about death - or more specifically, about how, by facing and accepting our coming death, we can all learn to live in a more vital, fearless and truthful way.---Backcover.

Summary: "Sharing is central to how we live today: it is what we do online; it is a model of economic behavior; and it is also a type of therapeutic talk. Sharing always comes with a warm glow around it, embodying positive values such as empathy, communication, fairness, openness and equality. The Age of Sharing shows how and when sharing became caring, and explains how its meanings have changed in the digital age. The Age of Sharing will appeal to students and scholars of the Internet, digital culture, and linguistics"-- Contents: Machine generated contents note: 1. Introduction, 2.

      '"100 nasty women of history" by Jewell, Hannah. Date: 2017. Summary: 100 fascinating and brilliantly written stories about history’s bravest, baddest but little known ’nasty’ women from across the world. In the final debate of the 2016 US presidential election, Donald Trump leaned into the microphone as Hillary Clinton spoke about social security and called his opponent ’such a nasty woman’. The phrase has stuck around and has since become something of a badge of honour for women around the world. Compiled and written by BuzzFeed writer Hannah Jewell, 100 Nasty Women of History contains profiles of women from across every century, race and continent, united in the fact that they were all a bit ’nasty’. From 3rd-century Japanese Empress Jingu to 20th-century British social reformer Octavia Hill, these are the women who were bold and powerful, but maybe put people (men’s) backs up by being so. 100 Nasty Women of History is an accessible, intelligent, hilarious (and sometimes sweary) guide to the history-making women whom you probably don’t know - but definitely should. Contents: 438 pages : illustrations ; 22 cm. Publisher: London : Hodder & Souughton Ltd, 2017. Subjects: Women -- History, Women -- Biography, Biographies',

      '"Lost libraries: Abigail Reynolds’ art journey" by Abigail Reynolds; editor: András Szántó; contributors: Thomas Girst, Marc Spiegler. Author / Creator: Reynolds, Abigail, 1975- author. Szántó, András editor. Girst, Thomas writer of foreword. Spiegler, Marc writer of introduction. Date: [2017]. Summary: The works of British artist Abigail Reynolds are always closely linked to literature. So it’s not surprising that the winner of the third BMW Art Journey researched historical book collections on several continents for her project ’The Ruins of Time: Lost Libraries Along the Silk Road’. On her five-month-long journey that took her from China through Kazakhstan to Turkey and Greece, Reynolds visited sites where libraries were lost due to political conflicts, plundering, natural disasters, and wars. These barren spaces symbolize the impossibility of comprehending and safeguarding all human knowledge. In this publication, photography and film stills from a 16mm camera supplement the artist’s literary recollections of her experiences. Contents: 256 pages : illustrations (chiefly color), maps ; 24 cm. cartographic image. Series: BMW art journey 2. Publisher: Berlin : Hatje Cantz Verlag GmbH, [2017]. Subjects: Reynolds, Abigail, 1975-; Libraries in art; Libraries -- Silk Road -- History; Libraries -- Destruction and pillage -- Silk Road -- History; Silk Road -- Description and travel. Notes: Statements of responsibility and publication information from colophon (page 256)',
